# Welcome to Your New Project!

## CI/CD Setup

A CI/CD pipeline has been pre-configured for you using Jenkins. Here's how it works:

1.  **`Jenkinsfile`**: This file defines the entire CI/CD process. You generally don't need to edit this.

2.  **`build.sh`**: This is where you define your project's build and test commands. The pipeline will automatically execute this script. **You must fill this file with your project's specific commands.**

3.  **Deployment**: The pipeline supports two deployment strategies:
    *   **Docker (Recommended)**: To use this, fill in the `Dockerfile` with your application's setup. The pipeline will automatically build and push the Docker image.
    *   **SSH (Fallback)**: If no `Dockerfile` is present, the pipeline will look for `deploy.ssh.json`. Fill in your server details there to deploy using SCP and SSH.

Happy coding!
